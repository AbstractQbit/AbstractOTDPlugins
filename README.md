# AbstractOTDPlugins
A set of plugins for OpenTabletDriver.


## Bezier interpolator
Interpolator that spatially smoothes out drawn lines by interpreting pen path as a continuous spline. Raw data points work as control points and midpoints between them work as end points of each curve. 


## [Radial Follow Smoothing](RadialFollow\README.md)
The Ultimate Smoothing Plugin, providing cursor stability while still allowing to hit fast jumps with ease.  
To view how different parameters affect the operating curve, open [RadialFollow/RadialFollowGraphs.ggb](RadialFollow/RadialFollowGraphs.ggb) in a [GeoGebra calculator](https://www.geogebra.org/calculator).
